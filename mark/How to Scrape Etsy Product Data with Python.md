# How to Scrape Etsy Product Data with Python

## Introduction

Etsy has become a $30 billion e-commerce giant, boasting over 4.4 million active sellers and nearly 82 million buyers, according to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/409375/etsy-active-buyers/). As one of the largest online marketplaces for unique, handmade, and creative goods, Etsy offers valuable insights for businesses.

If you're looking to break into a specific industry, analyze product trends, or gather pricing data, building an Etsy web scraper can save you time and uncover lucrative opportunities.

In this tutorial, we'll use Python's `Requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries to scrape Etsy product data, step by step.

## TL;DR: Complete Code

Hereâ€™s the complete code snippet for those in a hurry:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

etsy_products = []

for x in range(1, 251):
    response = requests.get(
        f'https://api.scraperapi.com?api_key=SCRAPE9837861&url=https://www.etsy.com/c/clothing/boys-clothing/costumes?ref=pagination&explicit=1&page={x}')
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

    products = soup.select('li.wt-show-md.wt-show-lg')
    for product in products:
        product_name = product.select_one('h3.v2-listing-card__title').text.strip()
        product_price = product.select_one('span.currency-value').text
        product_url = product.select_one('li.wt-list-unstyled div.js-merch-stash-check-listing a.listing-link')['href']
        etsy_products.append({
            'name': product_name,
            'price': product_price,
            'URL': product_url
        })

df = pd.DataFrame(etsy_products)
df.to_csv('etsy-products.csv', index=False)
```

### **Note:** 
Replace `SCRAPE9837861` with your ScraperAPI key.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Building an Etsy Scraper

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**

To get started, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
```

Once installed, create a new directory for your project and a file named `etsy-scraper.py` to house your script.

---

### **Step 2: Download Etsy HTML for Parsing**

Start by sending an HTTP request to Etsy to get the raw HTML for the page you want to scrape:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

response = requests.get(
    'https://www.etsy.com/c/clothing/boys-clothing/costumes?ref=pagination&explicit=1&page=1')
```

---

### **Step 3: Use CSS Selectors to Target Data**

To extract specific data from the HTML, such as product names, prices, and URLs, you'll need the correct CSS selectors. Use browser inspection tools (Ctrl+Shift+C on Windows or Cmd+Shift+C on Mac) or a tool like SelectorGadget.

Here are the key CSS selectors for the elements on the page:
- **Product Name**: `.v2-listing-card__title`
- **Product Price**: `.currency-value`
- **Product URL**: `div.js-merch-stash-check-listing a.listing-link`

---

### **Step 4: Parse and Extract Data**

Use `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML and extract the desired data:

```python
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
products = soup.select('li.wt-show-md.wt-show-lg')

for product in products:
    product_name = product.select_one('h3.v2-listing-card__title').text.strip()
    product_price = product.select_one('span.currency-value').text
    product_url = product.select_one('div.js-merch-stash-check-listing a.listing-link')['href']

    print(f"Name: {product_name}, Price: {product_price}, URL: {product_url}")
```

---

### **Step 5: Export Data to a CSV File**

Instead of printing the data to the console, store it in a Pandas DataFrame and save it as a CSV:

```python
import pandas as pd

etsy_products = []

for product in products:
    product_name = product.select_one('h3.v2-listing-card__title').text.strip()
    product_price = product.select_one('span.currency-value').text
    product_url = product.select_one('div.js-merch-stash-check-listing a.listing-link')['href']
    etsy_products.append({
        'name': product_name,
        'price': product_price,
        'URL': product_url
    })

df = pd.DataFrame(etsy_products)
df.to_csv('etsy-products.csv', index=False)
```

## Scraping Etsy at Scale

Now that weâ€™ve successfully scraped one page, letâ€™s scale it up to scrape multiple pages in the category.

### **Step 6: Loop Through Pagination**

Etsy paginates its results, and the page number is included in the URL as a query parameter (e.g., `?page=2`). To scrape all pages, use a loop:

```python
for x in range(1, 251):  # Assuming there are 250 pages
    response = requests.get(
        f'https://www.etsy.com/c/clothing/boys-clothing/costumes?ref=pagination&explicit=1&page={x}')
    # Add parsing logic here
```

---

### **Step 7: Avoid Getting Blocked with ScraperAPI**

To avoid IP bans and CAPTCHAs while scraping multiple pages, integrate ScraperAPI. ScraperAPI automates IP rotation, handles CAPTCHAs, and manages headers for you.

Modify your request to route through ScraperAPI:

```python
response = requests.get(
    f'https://api.scraperapi.com?api_key=SCRAPE9837861&url=https://www.etsy.com/c/clothing/boys-clothing/costumes?ref=pagination&explicit=1&page={x}')
```

Replace `SCRAPE9837861` with your ScraperAPI key.

---

### **Step 8: Combine Everything**

Hereâ€™s the full script for scraping Etsy at scale:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

etsy_products = []

for x in range(1, 251):
    response = requests.get(
        f'https://api.scraperapi.com?api_key=SCRAPE9837861&url=https://www.etsy.com/c/clothing/boys-clothing/costumes?ref=pagination&explicit=1&page={x}')
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

    products = soup.select('li.wt-show-md.wt-show-lg')
    for product in products:
        product_name = product.select_one('h3.v2-listing-card__title').text.strip()
        product_price = product.select_one('span.currency-value').text
        product_url = product.select_one('div.js-merch-stash-check-listing a.listing-link')['href']
        etsy_products.append({
            'name': product_name,
            'price': product_price,
            'URL': product_url
        })

df = pd.DataFrame(etsy_products)
df.to_csv('etsy-products.csv', index=False)
```
