# How to Use Asyncio to Scrape Websites with Python

## Introduction

In this article, we'll explore how to efficiently scrape websites using Python's coroutines and the `async`/`await` syntax. This approach eliminates the need to dive into threads ðŸ§µ and semaphores ðŸš¦. We'll utilize Python's `asyncio` module, along with the asynchronous HTTP library `aiohttp`, to build a scalable and efficient web scraping solution.

## What is Asyncio?

`asyncio` is part of Python's standard library, which means thereâ€™s no additional dependency to manage ðŸ¥³. It enables concurrency using asynchronous patterns, similar to what you may already know from JavaScript's `async` and `await`.

### Benefits of Asyncio

1. **Efficient Parallel Execution**: Perform tasks concurrently without needing full multi-threading.
2. **Simple Syntax**: Write asynchronous code in a readable, synchronous-looking style.
3. **Event Loop Management**: Automatically handles the execution of asynchronous tasks.

### Core Concepts of Asyncio

Asyncio relies on three key concepts:

- **Coroutines**: The basic building blocks of asynchronous programming. Declared using `async def`, these functions can call other asynchronous functions with `await`.
- **Tasks**: Used to schedule and execute coroutines. Created using `asyncio.create_task()`.
- **Futures**: Represent the eventual result of a coroutine.

For detailed technical documentation, visit [asyncio tasks documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#awaitables).

### How Does `async`/`await` Work?

The `async`/`await` syntax allows tasks to run concurrently without blocking each other. Letâ€™s take an example:

```python
import asyncio

async def say_hello(name):
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

async def main():
    tasks = [
        asyncio.create_task(say_hello("Alice")),
        asyncio.create_task(say_hello("Bob")),
        asyncio.create_task(say_hello("Charlie"))
    ]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Hereâ€™s what happens:
1. Each `say_hello` coroutine runs simultaneously, with a 1-second pause.
2. The entire script completes in just 1 second, instead of 3 seconds if run sequentially.

## Scraping Wikipedia Asynchronously

Now that you understand the basics of asyncio, letâ€™s use it to scrape Wikipedia. Our goal is to compile a list of programming languages and their creators.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Install the necessary libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install aiohttp beautifulsoup4
```

### Step 2: Crawling Wikipedia for Language Links

First, we need to collect all the links to programming language pages on Wikipedia.

```python
import aiohttp
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import asyncio

BASE_URL = "https://en.wikipedia.org"

async def fetch(session, url):
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        return await response.text()

async def crawl():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        html = await fetch(session, f"{BASE_URL}/wiki/List_of_programming_languages")
        soup = BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser")
        links = [
            BASE_URL + a["href"]
            for a in soup.select("div.div-col a")
            if "href" in a.attrs
        ]
        return links

async def main():
    links = await crawl()
    print(links)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Hereâ€™s what happens:
1. `fetch` retrieves the HTML of the page asynchronously.
2. `crawl` uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract links to individual programming language pages.
3. The list of links is printed.

### Step 3: Scraping Individual Language Pages

Next, we scrape each page to extract information about the programming language and its creator.

```python
async def scrape(session, url):
    html = await fetch(session, url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser")
    name = soup.select_one("caption.infobox-title")
    creator = soup.select_one("th:contains('Designed by') + td")
    return {
        "name": name.get_text(strip=True) if name else "N/A",
        "creator": creator.get_text(strip=True) if creator else "N/A"
    }

async def scrape_languages(links):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = [scrape(session, link) for link in links]
        return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

async def main():
    links = await crawl()
    results = await scrape_languages(links)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Key steps:
1. `scrape` retrieves and parses the HTML of each language page.
2. The language name and creator are extracted using CSS selectors.
3. All scraping tasks are executed concurrently with `asyncio.gather`.

## Enhancing Your Scraper with ScraperAPI

To handle common scraping challenges like IP bans, CAPTCHAs, and geo-restrictions, integrate ScraperAPI into your scraper.

### Using ScraperAPI

1. Add your API key and define a helper function:

   ```python
   from urllib.parse import urlencode

   API_KEY = "SCRAPE9837861"

   def get_scraperapi_url(url):
       payload = {"api_key": API_KEY, "url": url}
       return f"http://api.scraperapi.com/?{urlencode(payload)}"
   ```

2. Modify the `fetch` function to route requests through ScraperAPI:

   ```python
   async def fetch(session, url):
       scraper_url = get_scraperapi_url(url)
       async with session.get(scraper_url) as response:
           return await response.text()
   ```

By using ScraperAPI, your scraper can avoid detection and handle JavaScript-heavy pages seamlessly.
