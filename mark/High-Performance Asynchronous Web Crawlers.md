# High-Performance Asynchronous Web Crawlers

## Overview

Web crawling is a fundamental technique for automating data extraction from websites. By implementing asynchronous methods, we can achieve efficient and high-performance web scraping. This article explores asynchronous crawling techniques using Python and provides practical examples to demonstrate the concepts.

### Key Concepts

- **Asynchronous Requests**: A powerful approach to handle I/O operations like network requests.
- **Coroutine**: A function that can pause and resume its execution.
- **Task and Event Loop**: Core components of asynchronous operations, allowing for efficient task scheduling.

---

## Comparing Approaches

### 1. Multithreading and Multiprocessing (Not Recommended)
**Advantages**:
- Allows blocking operations to execute concurrently.

**Drawbacks**:
- Cannot scale indefinitely due to limitations in thread or process creation.

### 2. Thread Pool and Process Pool (Moderate Recommendation)
**Advantages**:
- Reduces system overhead by reusing threads or processes.

**Drawbacks**:
- Still limited by the maximum number of threads or processes in the pool.

### 3. Single-Threaded Asynchronous Coroutine (Highly Recommended)
**Advantages**:
- Efficiently handles I/O-bound tasks.
- Uses a single thread to manage multiple tasks without blocking.

**Core Components**:
- **event_loop**: The infinite loop managing task execution.
- **coroutine**: Defined using `async` and managed by the event loop.
- **task**: Encapsulates the state and execution of coroutines.
- **future**: Represents tasks that are scheduled for future execution.

## Example 1: Using Thread Pool in Web Crawling

The following example demonstrates how to implement a thread pool for web crawling:

### Code Implementation

```python
import os
import re
import requests
from lxml import etree
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def index():
    url = 'https://v.wuaishare.cn/liaofansixun.html'
    headers = {
        "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/103.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
    }
    page_text = requests.get(url=url, headers=headers).text
    tree = etree.HTML(page_text)
    p_list = tree.xpath('//*[@id="post-1569"]/div/div[1]/p')[1:]
    detail_list = []
    for p in p_list:
        title = p.xpath('./a/text()')[0]
        href = p.xpath('./a/@href')[0]
        detail_list.append((title, href))
    return detail_list

def download(detail):
    name = detail[0]
    href = detail[1]
    response = requests.get(url=href).text
    tree = etree.HTML(response)
    id_xpath = re.findall(".cn/(.*?).html", href, re.S)[0]
    strxpath = f'//*[@id="post-{id_xpath}"]/div/div[2]/p'
    p_list = tree.xpath(strxpath)
    word_list = [p.xpath('./text()')[0] for p in p_list]
    response_word = '\n\n'.join(word_list)
    response_word = name + response_word
    if not os.path.exists("liaofan"):
        os.makedirs("liaofan")
    file_path = os.path.join("liaofan", name + '.txt')
    with open(file_path, mode='w', encoding='utf-8') as fp:
        fp.write(response_word)
    print(name, "Download completed...")
    return name

if __name__ == '__main__':
    details = index()
    pool = ThreadPoolExecutor(10)  # Create a thread pool with 10 threads
    for detail in details:
        pool.submit(download, detail)
```

## Example 2: Asynchronous Web Crawling with Coroutine

Asynchronous crawling leverages Pythonâ€™s `aiohttp` for non-blocking HTTP requests.

### Prerequisite
Install the required library:
```bash
pip install aiohttp
```

### Code Implementation

```python
import os
import aiohttp
import asyncio
import requests
from lxml import etree

def index():
    url = "https://sc.chinaz.com/tupian/fengjingtupian.html"
    headers = {
        "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/103.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
    }
    image_list = []
    page_text = requests.get(url=url, headers=headers).text
    tree = etree.HTML(page_text)
    total_page = int(tree.xpath('/html/body/div[2]/div[6]/div[1]/a[8]/b/text()')[0])
    for page in range(1, total_page + 1):
        new_url = url if page == 1 else f'https://sc.chinaz.com/tupian/fengjingtupian_{page}.html'
        response = requests.get(url=new_url, headers=headers).text
        tree = etree.HTML(response)
        div_list = tree.xpath('//*[@id="container"]/div')
        for div in div_list:
            image_title = div.xpath('./div/a/img/@alt')[0].encode('iso-8859-1').decode('utf-8')
            image_path = "https://" + div.xpath('./div/a/img/@src')[0].encode('iso-8859-1').decode('utf-8')
            image_list.append((image_title, image_path))
    return image_list

async def fetch(session, image_item):
    url = image_item[1]
    title = image_item[0]
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        content = await response.read()
        file_name = f"images/{title}.jpg"
        os.makedirs("images", exist_ok=True)
        with open(file_name, mode='wb') as fp:
            fp.write(content)
        print(f"{title} downloaded...")

async def get_request(image_list):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = [asyncio.create_task(fetch(session, item)) for item in image_list]
        await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    images = index()
    asyncio.run(get_request(images))
```

---

### Key Notes on Asynchronous Crawling

1. **Replace `requests` with `aiohttp`**:
   - `aiohttp.ClientSession` is used to initiate asynchronous HTTP requests.
   - Use `await` to pause the coroutine until the request completes.

2. **Data Parsing and Writing**:
   - Asynchronous functions like `fetch` handle both data fetching and file writing.

3. **Handling IP Bans**:
   - Use proxy IPs if facing access restrictions or rate limits.
