## Introduction

Why focus on Amazon? As one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world, Amazon is a treasure trove of valuable data, including product information, pricing trends, customer feedback, and emerging market trends. Sellers can use this data to monitor competitors, researchers can analyze market trends, and consumers can make informed purchase decisions.

In this guide, youâ€™ll learn how to scrape Amazon data manually using Python libraries such as Beautiful Soup and Playwright. Additionally, weâ€™ll explore how **Bright Data** can streamline this process with advanced scraping tools and ready-made datasets.

## Getting Started: Scraping Amazon Data with Python

Before extracting data from Amazon, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed on your computer. Familiarity with web scraping and basic HTML is also helpful.

### Prerequisites

1. Install Python on your system (version 3.7.9 or higher is recommended). If youâ€™re new to Python, check out this [web scraping guide](https://bit.ly/Scraperapi) for step-by-step instructions.
2. Create a new project directory and install the following libraries:
   - **Requests**: Handles HTTP requests in Python.
   - **Pandas**: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.
   - **Beautiful Soup**: Parses HTML content.
   - **Playwright**: Automates web browsing tasks.

Use the following commands to set up your environment:

```bash
mkdir scraping-amazon-python && cd scraping-amazon-python

pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests
pip install pandas
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

### Understanding Amazonâ€™s Page Layout

Amazonâ€™s website contains structured product listings, including titles, prices, ratings, and other details. Follow these steps to inspect its HTML structure:

1. Visit the Amazon website.
2. Search for a product or category.
3. Right-click on a product and select **Inspect** to open the developer tools.
4. Examine the HTML layout to identify tags and attributes for data extraction.

## Scraping Amazon Data with Playwright

The code below demonstrates how to scrape product details such as name, price, rating, and review count using Playwright.

### Example: `amazon_scraper.py`

```python
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright
import pandas as pd

async def scrape_amazon():
    async with async_playwright() as pw:
        browser = await pw.chromium.launch(headless=True)
        page = await browser.new_page()
        await page.goto('https://www.amazon.com/s?i=fashion&bbn=115958409011')
        
        results = []
        listings = await page.query_selector_all('div.a-section.a-spacing-small')

        for listing in listings:
            result = {}
            name = await listing.query_selector('h2 > a > span')
            result['product_name'] = await name.inner_text() if name else 'N/A'

            rating = await listing.query_selector('span[aria-label*="out of 5 stars"]')
            result['rating'] = await rating.inner_text() if rating else 'N/A'

            reviews = await listing.query_selector('span[aria-label*="stars"] + span > a > span')
            result['number_of_reviews'] = await reviews.inner_text() if reviews else 'N/A'

            price = await listing.query_selector('span.a-price > span.a-offscreen')
            result['price'] = await price.inner_text() if price else 'N/A'

            if all(value == 'N/A' for value in result.values()):
                continue
            results.append(result)

        await browser.close()
        return results

# Save results to CSV
results = asyncio.run(scrape_amazon())
df = pd.DataFrame(results)
df.to_csv('amazon_products.csv', index=False)
```

## Advanced Amazon Scraping Techniques

Amazonâ€™s robust anti-scraping measures can make data collection challenging. Here are advanced techniques to improve your scraperâ€™s efficiency and resilience:

### 1. Handling Pagination
Use the **Next Page** button to navigate through paginated results. Identify its unique selector and programmatically click to move to the next page.

### 2. Bypassing Sponsored Ads
Filter out sponsored ads by checking for tags like `Sponsored` or `Ad`. This ensures youâ€™re only collecting actual product data.

### 3. Mitigating Blocks
Introduce random delays between requests and rotate user agents or IP addresses to mimic human browsing. ScraperAPI offers built-in proxy rotation to simplify this process. ðŸ‘‰ [Start your free trial today!](https://bit.ly/Scraperapi)

### 4. Scraping Dynamic Content
For dynamic sections like reviews, use Playwright or Selenium to wait for JavaScript-rendered content to load.

### 5. Rate Limiting
Limit concurrent requests to avoid being blacklisted. Use `asyncio.sleep()` to introduce random pauses.

AUTH = f'{USERNAME}:{PASSWORD}'
HOST = 'zproxy.lum-superproxy.io'

async def scrape_brightdata():
    async with async_playwright() as pw:
        browser = await pw.chromium.connect_over_cdp(f'wss://{AUTH}@{HOST}')
        page = await browser.new_page()
        await page.goto('https://www.amazon.com/s?i=fashion&bbn=115958409011')

        results = []
        listings = await page.query_selector_all('div.a-section.a-spacing-small')

        for listing in listings:
            result = {}
            name = await listing.query_selector('h2 > a > span')
            result['product_name'] = await name.inner_text() if name else 'N/A'

            price = await listing.query_selector('span.a-price > span.a-offscreen')
            result['price'] = await price.inner_text() if price else 'N/A'

            results.append(result)

        await browser.close()
        return results

# Save results
results = asyncio.run(scrape_brightdata())
```

Replace placeholders like `YOUR_BRIGHTDATA_USERNAME` with your Bright Data credentials.
